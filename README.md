# Summary
This password generator will produce a password based off of a user's answer to a character length prompt, and choices on which desired character types to include. Additionally, the password will be able to be copied to the clipboard using a Copy to Clipboard button. The purpose of this project was to use javascript, css, and html to create a mobile responsive application that will produce a random password.
    
# Access
My updated portfolio can be accessed [Here](https://jsmithxyz.github.io/new-portfolio/ "Here")

# Installation
This portfolio was built using the CSS framework, Materialize. 
HTML, JavaScript, CSS, JQuery Plugins, Font Awesome, and Google Fonts were used for design and functionality.

# Usage
This portfolio's purpose is to display 'About Me' information, recent projects, as well as contact information.

The icons in the top right of the landing page will scroll the user to the portfolio section and contact sections, respectively, when clicked. 

The pulsing '+' button will open an 'About Me' modal. Here you will also be able to download a PDF version of my Résumé.

When you hit the blue down arrow icon, the screen will scroll to my 'recent projects' section. Here you can click on an image to view the title, and description of each app. You can click the 'View App' button to then go to a deployed version of the application.

Below that section, there is a white down arrow that will scroll to the 'Contact' section when clicked. Here you will be able to acces my Phone Number, E-mail, LinkedIn profile, and Github profile.
